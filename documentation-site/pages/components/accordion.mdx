# Accordion

<Yard placeholderHeight={180} {...accordionYardConfig} />

Accordions display a list of high-level options that can expand/contract to reveal more detailed information.

## Accessibility

- `tab`, `shift + tab` - switch between panels.
- `arrow up`, `arrow down`, `home`, `end` - switch between panels (won't shift focus outside of
  accordion if you attempt to move beyond the first or last panel).
- `space` or `enter` - when focus is on the accordion panel header it will toggle (expand or
  collapse) the currently focused panel.

If you want to control the `expanded` state of the accordion panels yourself, you can use the stateless version of our accordion: `StatelessAccordion`. You can pass a list of React keys to `expanded`, which corresponds to the keys of the `Panels` that you want to be expanded.

The `onChange` handler is called when one of the `Panels` would ordinarily be opened. It passes both the `key` of the `Panel` that caused the handler to fire as well as an updated `expanded` list. You can choose to use the new `expanded` list or `key` however you like to update your state. Note, by default the new `expanded` list will assume only one panel can be open at a time, but if you pass `accordion={false}` the `expanded` list will assume multiple can be open simultaneously.

The `StatelessAccordion` gives you the flexibility to control the accordion as you like while still offering some convenience to cover the normal use cases.

**Note:** the `Panel` has the same overrides as `Accordion`, with the exception of the `Root` subcomponent.
